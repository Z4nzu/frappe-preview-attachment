# Frappe Attachment Preview

This Frappe app introduces a functionality to preview file attachments directly within the Frappe framework. By adding an **icon** next to each attachment, users can quickly view the content of attached files without downloading them.

## Features

- **Preview Dialog**: Provides a dedicated icon for each attachment that opens a dialog box to preview the file when clicked.
- **Draggable and Resizable Dialog**: The preview dialog can be stretched, dragged, and moved for better usability.
- **Supports Multiple File Types**: View various file formats directly in the browser, including:
  - Images
  - PDFs
  - Videos
  - Text Files
  - JSON Files
  - XML Files
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Saves time by allowing users to preview attachments without opening in a new tab.
